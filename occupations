   <h1>Occupations</h1>
    <p>There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, 
      who often work closely together on a website.[30] The web designers are responsible for the visual 
      aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also 
      have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their 
      knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations one 
      person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger
      organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.[31]</p>

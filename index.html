  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. 
    The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, 
    including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization.
    Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some 
    designers will cover them all.[1] The term web design is normally used to describe the design process 
    relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing mark up. Web design partially 
    overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an 
    awareness of usability and if their role involves creating mark up then they are also expected to be up to 
    date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
    
   <h1>History</h1>
   <h2>1988-2001</h2>
   <p>Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design. 
      However, web design can also be seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a large part of 
      people’s everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics, different styles 
      of typography, background, and music.</p>

   <h3>The start of the web and web design</h3>
   <p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which 
     later became known as the World Wide Web. During 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only pages could 
      be viewed using a simple line-mode browser.[2] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the Mosaic 
      browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and 
      naturally text heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or 
      sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[3] The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World 
     Wide Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its 
      interoperability."[4] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and 
     programming language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C 
     continues to set standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript. In 1994 Andreessen formed 
     Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. 
     Netscape created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, 
     Netscape 1.1 included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. 
     Throughout 1996 to 1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser 
     dominance. During this time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, a
      Dynamic HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web 
      design evolve at a rapid pace.[5]</p>

    <h3>Evolution of web design</h2>
    <p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features 
      and tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an 
      obscure authoring technique.[5] The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying 
      tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating 
      the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and 
      good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good mark-up structure, and little attention was 
      paid to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even 
      more so with earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use 
      complicated table structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from 
      collapsing.[6] CSS was introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. 
      This allowed HTML code to be semantic rather than both semantic and presentational, and improved 
      web accessibility, see tableless web design.</p>

    <p>In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content 
      development tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a
      limited precursor to ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the 
      point of HTML, animated GIFs and JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web 
      developers avoided using it for fear of limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. 
      Instead, designers reverted to gif animations (if they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) 
      and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash made it popular enough among specific target 
      markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of browsers, and powerful enough to be used 
      to develop entire sites.[6]</p>

    <h3>End of the first browser wars</h3>
    <p>During 1998 Netscape released Netscape Communicator code under an open source licence, 
      enabling thousands of developers to participate in improving the software. However, they 
      decided to start from the beginning, which guided the development of the open source browser
      and soon expanded to a complete application platform.[5] The Web Standards Project was formed 
      and promoted browser compliance with HTML and CSS standards by creating Acid1, Acid2, and Acid3 
      tests. 2000 was a big year for Microsoft. Internet Explorer was released for Mac; this was significant 
      as it was the first browser that fully supported HTML 4.01 and CSS 1, raising the bar in terms of 
      standards compliance. It was also the first browser to fully support the PNG image format.[5] During 
      this time Netscape was sold to AOL and this was seen as Netscape’s official loss to Microsoft in the 
      browser wars.[5]</p>

    <h2>2001–2012</h2>
    <p>Since the start of the 21st century the web has become more and more integrated into peoples lives. 
      As this has happened the technology of the web has also moved on. There have also been significant 
      changes in the way people use and access the web, and this has changed how sites are designed.</p>

    <p>Since the end of the browsers wars[when?] new browsers have been released. Many of these are 
      open source meaning that they tend to have faster development and are more supportive of new standards. 
      The new options are considered by many[weasel words] to be better than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p>

    <p>The W3C has released new standards for HTML (HTML5) and CSS (CSS3), as well as new JavaScript API's, 
      each as a new but individual standard.[when?] While the term HTML5 is only used to refer to the new 
      version of HTML and some of the JavaScript API's, it has become common to use it to refer to the entire 
      suite of new standards (HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript).</p>

    <h1>Tools and technologies</h1>
    <p>Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process 
      they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the 
      principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors 
      to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes. Technologies used to create websites include 
      W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or generated by WYSIWYG editing software. 
      Other tools web designers might use include mark up validators[7] and other testing tools for 
      usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.[8]</p>

    <h1>Skills and techniques</h1>
    <h2>Marketing and communication design</h2>
    <p>Marketing and communication design on a website may identify what works for its target market. 
      This can be an age group or particular strand of culture; thus the designer may understand the 
      trends of its audience. Designers may also understand the type of website they are designing, 
      meaning, for example, that (B2B) business-to-business website design considerations might differ 
      greatly from a consumer targeted website such as a retail or entertainment website. Careful 
      consideration might be made to ensure that the aesthetics or overall design of a site do not 
      clash with the clarity and accuracy of the content or the ease of web navigation,[9] especially 
      on a B2B website. Designers may also consider the reputation of the owner or business the site 
      is representing to make sure they are portrayed favourably.</p>

    <h2>User experience design and interactive design</h2>
    <p>User understanding of the content of a website often depends on user understanding of how 
      the website works. This is part of the user experience design. User experience is related to 
      layout, clear instructions and labeling on a website. How well a user understands how they can 
      interact on a site may also depend on the interactive design of the site. If a user perceives the 
      usefulness of the website, they are more likely to continue using it. Users who are skilled and well 
      versed with website use may find a more distinctive, yet less intuitive or less user-friendly website 
      interface useful nonetheless. However, users with less experience are less likely to see the advantages 
      or usefulness of a less intuitive website interface. This drives the trend for a more universal user 
      experience and ease of access to accommodate as many users as possible regardless of user skill.[10] 
      Much of the user experience design and interactive design are considered in the user interface design.

    <p>Advanced interactive functions may require plug-ins if not advanced coding language skills. 
      Choosing whether or not to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in 
      user experience design. If the plug-in doesn't come pre-installed with most browsers, there's a 
      risk that the user will have neither the know how or the patience to install a plug-in just to 
      access the content. If the function requires advanced coding language skills, it may be too 
      costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function 
      will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be 
      incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that 
      doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. 
      It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.</p>

    <h2>Page layout</h2>
    <p>Part of the user interface design is affected by the quality of the page layout. For example, 
      a designer may consider whether the site's page layout should remain consistent on different 
      pages when designing the layout. Page pixel width may also be considered vital for aligning 
      objects in the layout design. The most popular fixed-width websites generally have the same 
      set width to match the current most popular browser window, at the current most popular screen 
      resolution, on the current most popular monitor size. Most pages are also center-aligned for 
      concerns of aesthetics on larger screens.</p>

    <!-- Use images from linked site -->
    <p>Fluid layouts increased in popularity around 2000 as an alternative to HTML-table-based 
      layouts and grid-based design in both page layout design principle and in coding technique, 
      but were very slow to be adopted.[note 1] This was due to considerations of screen reading 
      devices and varying windows sizes which designers have no control over. Accordingly, a design 
      may be broken down into units (sidebars, content blocks, embedded advertising areas, navigation 
      areas) that are sent to the browser and which will be fitted into the display window by the 
      browser, as best it can. As the browser does recognize the details of the reader's screen 
      (window size, font size relative to window etc.) the browser can make user-specific layout 
      adjustments to fluid layouts, but not fixed-width layouts. Although such a display may often 
      change the relative position of major content units, sidebars may be displaced below body 
      text rather than to the side of it. This is a more flexible display than a hard-coded 
      grid-based layout that doesn't fit the device window. In particular, the relative 
      position of content blocks may change while leaving the content within the block 
      unaffected. This also minimizes the user's need to horizontally scroll the page.</p>

    <!-- Use images from linked site -->
    <p>Responsive Web Design is a newer approach, based on CSS3, and a deeper level of per-device 
      specification within the page's stylesheet through an enhanced use of the CSS @media rule. In 
      March 2018 Google announced they would be rolling out mobile-first indexing.[11]Sites using 
      responsive design are well placed to ensure they meet this new approach.</p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <!-- Use images from linked site on web safe fonts -->
    <p>Web designers may choose to limit the variety of website typefaces to only a few 
      which are of a similar style, instead of using a wide range of typefaces or type styles. 
      Most browsers recognize a specific number of safe fonts, which designers mainly use in order 
      to avoid complications.</p>

    <p>Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module and has since been implemented 
      in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in 
      web typography, as well as the usage of font downloading.</p>

    <p>Most site layouts incorporate negative space to break the text up into paragraphs and also 
      avoid center-aligned text.[12]</p>

    <h2>Motion graphics</h2>
    <p>The page layout and user interface may also be affected by the use of motion graphics. 
      The choice of whether or not to use motion graphics may depend on the target market for 
      the website. Motion graphics may be expected or at least better received with an 
      entertainment-oriented website. However, a website target audience with a more serious or 
      formal interest (such as business, community, or government) might find animations unnecessary 
      and distracting if only for entertainment or decoration purposes. This doesn't mean that more 
      serious content couldn't be enhanced with animated or video presentations that is relevant to 
      the content. In either case, motion graphic design may make the difference between more effective 
      visuals or distracting visuals.</p>

    <p>Motion graphics that are not initiated by the site visitor can produce accessibility issues. 
      The World Wide Web consortium accessibility standards require that site visitors be able to disable 
      the animations.[13]</p>

    <h2>Quality of code</h2>
    <p>Website designers may consider it to be good practice to conform to standards. This is usually 
      done via a description specifying what the element is doing. Failure to conform to standards may 
      not make a website unusable or error prone, but standards can relate to the correct layout of 
      pages for readability as well making sure coded elements are closed appropriately. This includes 
      errors in code, more organized layout for code, and making sure IDs and classes are identified 
      properly. Poorly-coded pages are sometimes colloquially called tag soup. Validating via W3C[7] 
      can only be done when a correct DOCTYPE declaration is made, which is used to highlight errors 
      in code. The system identifies the errors and areas that do not conform to web design standards. 
      This information can then be corrected by the user.[14]</p>

    <h2>Generated content</h2>
      <p>There are two ways websites are generated: statically or dynamically.</p>

    <h3>Static websites</h3>
<!-- Use images from linked site -->
    <p>Main article: <i><a href="">Static web page</a></i></p>
      <p>A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website. Each time that page is 
      requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during the design of the 
      website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated creation process, 
      similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages. 
      These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators 
      such as Jekyll and Adobe Muse.[15]</p>

    <p>The benefits of a static website are that they were simpler to host, as their server only needed 
      to serve static content, not execute server-side scripts. This required less server administration 
      and had less chance of exposing security holes. They could also serve pages more quickly, on low-cost 
      server hardware. These advantage became less important as cheap web hosting expanded to also offer 
      dynamic features, and virtual servers offered high performance for short intervals at low cost.</p>

    <p>Almost all websites have some static content, as supporting assets such as images and stylesheets
      are usually static, even on a website with highly dynamic pages.</p>

      <h3>Dynamic websites</h3>
<!-- Use images from linked site -->
  <p>Main article: <i><a href="">Dynamic web page</a></i></p>
    <p>Dynamic websites are generated on the fly and use server-side technology to generate webpages. 
      They typically extract their content from one or more back-end databases: some are database queries 
      across a relational database to query a catalogue or to summarise numeric information, others may use 
      a document database such as MongoDB or NoSQL to store larger units of content, such as blog posts or 
      wiki articles.</p>

    <p>In the design process, dynamic pages are often mocked-up or wireframed using static pages. The 
      skillset needed to develop dynamic web pages is much broader than for a static pages, involving 
      server-side and database coding as well as client-side interface design. Even medium-sized dynamic 
      projects are thus almost always a team effort.</p>

    <p>When dynamic web pages first developed, they were typically coded directly in languages such as 
      Perl, PHP or ASP. Some of these, notably PHP and ASP, used a 'template' approach where a server-side 
      page resembled the structure of the completed client-side page and data was inserted into places 
      defined by 'tags'. This was a quicker means of development than coding in a purely procedural coding 
      language such as Perl.</p>

    <p>Both of these approaches have now been supplanted for many websites by higher-level application-focused 
      tools such as content management systems. These build on top of general purpose coding platforms and
      assume that a website exists to offer content according to one of several well recognised models, such 
      as a time-sequenced blog, a thematic magazine or news site, a wiki or a user forum. These tools make 
      the implementation of such a site very easy, and a purely organisational and design-based task, 
      without requiring any coding.</p>

    <p>Editing the content itself (as well as the template page) can be done both by means of the site 
      itself, and with the use of third-party software. The ability to edit all pages is provided only 
      to a specific category of users (for example, administrators, or registered users). In some cases, 
      anonymous users are allowed to edit certain web content, which is less frequent (for example, on 
      forums - adding messages). An example of a site with an anonymous change is Wikipedia.</p>

      <h1>Homepage design</h1>
    <p>Usability experts, including Jakob Nielsen and Kyle Soucy, have often emphasised homepage design 
      for website success and asserted that the homepage is the most important page on a 
      website.[16][17][18][19] However practitioners into the 2000s were starting to find that a 
      growing number of website traffic was bypassing the homepage, going directly to internal content 
      pages through search engines, e-newsletters and RSS feeds.[20] Leading many practitioners to argue 
      that homepages are less important than most people think.[21][22][23][24] Jared Spool argued in 2007 
      that a site's homepage was actually the least important page on a website.[25]</p>

    <p>In 2012 and 2013, carousels (also called 'sliders' and 'rotating banners') have become an extremely 
      popular design element on homepages, often used to showcase featured or recent content in a confined 
      space.[26][27] Many practitioners argue that carousels are an ineffective design element and hurt a 
      website's search engine optimisation and usability.[27][28][29]</p>

      <h1>Occupations</h1>
    <p>There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, 
      who often work closely together on a website.[30] The web designers are responsible for the visual 
      aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page. Web designers will also 
      have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their 
      knowledge will differ from one web designer to another. Particularly in smaller organizations one 
      person will need the necessary skills for designing and programming the full web page, while larger
      organizations may have a web designer responsible for the visual aspect alone.[31]</p>


      <p>Further jobs which may become involved in the creation of a website include:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>Graphic designers to create visuals for the site such as logos, layouts and buttons
    <li>Internet marketing specialists to help maintain web presence through strategic solutions on targeting 
      viewers to the site, by using marketing and promotional techniques on the internet
    <li>SEO writers to research and recommend the correct words to be incorporated into a particular website 
      and make the website more accessible and found on numerous search engines
    <li>Internet copywriter to create the written content of the page to appeal to the targeted viewers of 
      the site[1]
    <li>User experience (UX) designer incorporates aspects of user focused design considerations which 
      include information architecture, user centered design, user testing, interaction design, and 
      occasionally visual design.
